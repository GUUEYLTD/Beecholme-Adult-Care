            <div class="counsellors-info-item-text">
                <p>Paying and communicating through BAC helps ensure that you're protected under our Terms and Conditions of Service, cancellation and refund policies. It acts as a safeguard, we can't provide these benefits if your session is not booked and paid for directly through BAC.</p>
                <p>Paying or communication outside of BAC also makes it harder for us to protect your information and puts you at greater risk of fraud and other security issues.</p>
