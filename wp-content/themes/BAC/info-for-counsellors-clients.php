                <p>
                    We are launching a major marketing campaign with a social media campaign to get clients!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are building a new login area where counsellors will be able to message directly with their clients through the platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So far we recommend our counsellors not to share any personal contact details (email address or/and phone number). If you require to communicate with clients you can email your requests at online@beecholmeadultcare.co.uk, we will then get in contact with client and get back to you with all the necessary information.
